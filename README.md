# Social_Media_Website_MERN_Stack
Before compiling, Update separate node modules in both client and server folder. (using npm update)

About the Project:

The application offers **user registration** and authentication functionality. Users can create accounts by providing necessary details, which are securely stored in the database. **Authentication** is implemented using industry-standard techniques such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure user authentication and authorization.

Users can create posts within the application, sharing messages, images, or other media content. Hashtags can be added to posts, allowing for categorization and organization. Users can interact with posts by liking and commenting, fostering engagement and social interaction. The application provides appropriate APIs and data structures to enable seamless post creation and interaction.

**Pagination** is implemented to optimize performance and improve the user experience. It allows for the efficient retrieval and display of a subset of posts, enhancing browsing speed and reducing resource consumption. Comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations enable users to manage their posts and perform actions such as editing, deleting, or updating post information.

The application incorporates a robust **search functionality** that allows users to search for posts based on tags or specific post details. MongoDB's querying capabilities are leveraged to efficiently retrieve relevant posts, providing users with accurate and timely search results. This enhances content discovery and enables users to find posts of interest quickly.

In summary, this social media application project demonstrates my proficiency in the **MERN stack**, including ReactJS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I have developed a feature-rich application that enables users to register, create posts, interact with content, perform CRUD operations, implement pagination, and search for posts based on tags or specific details.
